        If you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy 
        to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa. More 
        specifically, abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c"). If you use 
        abi.encodePacked for signatures, authentication or data integrity, make sure to always use 
        the same types and check that at most one of them is dynamic. Unless there is a compelling 
        reason, abi.encode should be preferred.
